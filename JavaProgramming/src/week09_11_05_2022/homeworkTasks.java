    Task 3 :   Write a method that can check if a number is Armstrong number

                Note: if I have a 3-digit number then each of the digits is raised to the power of three and added to obtain a number. If the number obtained equals the original number then, we call that armstrong number.

                Armstrong numbers are     === 153 370 371 407 === for 3 digits






                Task 6 : Write a method that return a new string where the first and last chars have been exchanged.


             frontBack("code") → "eodc"
             frontBack("a") → "a"
             frontBack("ab") → "ba"





    Task 7 : Write a method that given 2 int values, return true if either of them is in the range 10..20 inclusive.
            multiple parameter  --- takes two integers
            return type --- boolean

             in1020(12, 99) → true
             in1020(21, 12) → true
             in1020(8, 99) → false
