        If & else statement we can NEVER apply for the tasks that requires more than
        two condition!!!!!!!

        Multi-branch If Statement
        *multi-branch if Statement can be nested to create an else if clause

        *it is used to make decision among several alternatives
                        SYNTAX
          if(Condition1){
             Statements
          }else if(Condition2){
             Statements
          }else{
             Statements
          }

  !!! Multiple ELSE IF blocks can be given if needed
At least needed 3 statements for multi-branch else if
only one block gets executed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for ex:
 yes or no
 female or male
 leap year or not leap year
 pass or fail
 married or not married
 employed or not employed
 odd or even
 eligible or not eligible



        The if...else statement checks a condition.
        If it resolves to TRUE the first code block is executed.
        If the condition resolves to FALSE, the second code block is run instead.
